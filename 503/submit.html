  <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
  <h2>Submitting your work</h2>
  <p>Once you have completed the work, you will submit the entire <em>YourNameHTML</em> folder to your  instructor following the instructions below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Make  sure that all changes to the HTML and CSS files have been saved, and close all  open files.</li>
    <li>Find  the <em>YourNameHTML</em> folder in the  Computer window. Open the file to verify that it contains the following files:
      <ul>
        <li>introduction.html</li>
        <li>picture.jpg</li>
        <li>style.css<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If  your folder includes any other files, you can delete them at this point. You  may also want to open the HTML file in your browser to verify that it looks  right one last time before submitting it.</li>
    <li>Use  the Computer Back arrow so that you can see the <em>YourNameHTML</em> folder itself, instead of the contents of the folder.</li>
    <li>Right-click  the folder. Point to Send To in the Shortcut menu, then click on Compressed  (Zipped) folder in the submenu.</li>
    <li>This  will create a new file named <strong>YourNameHTML</strong>,  but with the icon for a zipped folder.</li>
    <li>Submit  the zipped folder to the dropbox for this assignment in the online course,  following the instructions given by your instructor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This assignment will be graded using the following rubric:<br>
