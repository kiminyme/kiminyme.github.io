  <h1>Introduction to HTML  </h1>
  <h3>Assignment Description</h3>
  <p>This exercise is designed as one assignment in a Computer Concepts course for first-year university students in a business major. The course as a whole has the goal of introducing students to specific aspects of computers to help them learn to use computers more effectively for  personal, acadmic, and professional goals. One topic included in the course is an overview of the World Wide Web and how it is used. This activity and assignment would be incorporated into that lesson, as a hands-on component to illustrate how Web pages are created. </p>
  <p>The goal of this assignment is to show students how HTML5 and CSS3 are used to format and lay out a Web page. This is not a critical skill for most of the students who take the class, but given the widespread use of Websites for business purposes, it is a basic skill that most users can learn easily and which may be useful in the future. As the Web becomes more integrated into our society, the need to be able to format pages in HTML has become a useful tool in a wide variety of settings.</p>
  <p>It is assumed that the learners have a basic understanding of how to use a text editor, how to save files in a specific file format, and how to use folders to organize files. The instructions assume that the student will use Windows (which is installed on all campus computers, and which is available through a VDI interface to all students off campus), including Notepad as a plain text editor and a browser of their choice. The files will be saved locally and not published online, so a Web server is not required.</p>
  <p>The instruction will be available online. Because the class is offered both online and in a classroom setting, the same instructional content will be available to both, although the presentation of the material may be different in each context.</p>
  <p class='listhead'><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Demonstrate the use of HTML to format a page, using at least three different HTML tags (including headings, paragraphs, bulleted lists, and sections).
    </li>
    <li>Demonstrate how to include external hyperlinks in a Web page.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrate how to include at least one picture in a Web page.
    </li>
    <li>Apply CSS formatting to a Web page.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Videos with an overview of each part of the assignment will be provided as part of the instruction. Students in the classroom version of the course may receive this instruction in person from the teacher of the course, or the teacher may choose to show the video during class time, with an opportunity for discussion afterward.</p>
  <p>Students will be provided with an HTML file containing placeholder text and the HTML &ldquo;envelope&rdquo; code already in place (including the HTML, TITLE, HEAD, and BODY tags) to use as a starting point for the assignment, as well as a CSS file with basic formatting statements. See the following screenshots:</p>
<p>Sample HTML file:<br>

<p>Sample CSS file:<br>
