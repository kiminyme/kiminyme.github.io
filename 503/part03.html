  <p>As you may remember from your readings for this week, the  World Wide Web was invented around 1990, primarily as a way of linking research  papers to each other. Back then, Internet connections were relatively slow by  our standards, and HTML was designed to be a text-only platform that could be  transferred quickly from one computer to the next, even with a slow connection.  In fact, an HTML file can only contain text--it is not possible to embed a picture  or sound file into the HTML file itself.</p>
  <p>In order to include media like pictures and videos in a Web  page, the web developer has to make that content available as separate files on  the Web server. The HTML page itself includes code that tells the browser where  to find the media file, as well as where the content should appear on the page.  In some ways, this is similar to adding a hyperlink, except that the user can  see the content embedded in the page, instead of having to click a link to see  the content..</p>
<p>For this part of the assignment, you are asked to add a  picture of your choice to the page.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Find  a picture file to use for this assignment, and put a copy of the file in the <em>YourNameHTML</em> folder. You may use a  picture of yourself, a child, a pet, or any other subject, but it must be a  picture that you have the right to use--either because you took the picture  personally or the person who took the picture has given you permission to use  it. Also make sure that it is appropriate for public distribution (no nudity or  violence!).</li>
  <li>You  will need to make sure that the picture file is in JPEG format, that it is  small enough to fit in the browser window, and that it has the filename picture.  Use the following steps to make these changes.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Open Windows Paint through  the Start menu, then use File/Open in Paint to open your picture file. <strong>Double-clicking the file will not  automatically open the file in Paint.</strong></li>
    <li>Resize the image so that it is no more than 600  pixels wide. You can do this by clicking the Resize button in the Home ribbon,  selecting the Pixels option, then keying a number that is 600 or less in the  Horizontal box.<br>
      <br>
      <img src="media/html_fig3-1.png" width="250" height="358" alt="Screenshot of resizing dialog box"/><br>
      <br>
      If your picture file is already less than 600 pixels wide, do not make any  changes here. Just click the Cancel button to close the Resize and Skew dialog  box. Otherwise, click OK to apply the change to your picture. You will see the  picture resize in the Paint window if you made changes.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>To save the file as <em>picture.jpg</em>, click the File tab, point to Save As, then click <em>JPEG Picture</em> in the submenu:<br>
      <br>
      <img src="media/html_fig3-2.png" width="525" height="554" alt="Screenshot of Save As menu"/><br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that the file is being saved to the <em>YourNameHTML </em>folder created for this  assignment. Enter the filename <em>picture</em> in the Save As dialog box that opens, then click OK.</li>
    <li>Close Paint and return to the <em>YourNameHTML</em> folder in the Computer  window. Delete your original picture file, so that the folder contains only  three files:
      <ul>
        <li>introduction</li>
        <li>picture</li>
        <li>style<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
  <li>In  the HTML file in the Notepad window, choose a location for the picture. In the  examples here, the picture is added above the hyperlink, but you could choose  to add the picture in a different place if you wish. Note that the picture must  be inside the &lt;body&gt; tags and that it should not be placed inside a  paragraph of text.</li>
  <li>In  the chosen location, add the code shown in the screen shot below:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="media/html_fig3-3.png" width="600" height="217" alt="Screenshot of HTML file with img tag"/><br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Save  the Notepad file and refresh your browser window. If you added the code  correctly, the picture should appear in the desired location on the page:<br>
    <br>
    <img src="media/html_fig3-4.png" width="600" height="550" alt="Screenshot of Web page with photo"/><br>
  </li>
</ol>
  If the picture does not appear, or if it is in  the wrong place, return to the Notepad file to make corrections. Remember to  save the Notepad file and refresh the browser window to check that the  corrections worked. Once you are satisfied with the results, continue to the  next part of the assignment.<br>
<p>When you are happy with the page content and layout, move  onto <a href="part04.html">Part 4</a>.<br>
