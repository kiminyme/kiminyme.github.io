<h3>Provide References</h3>
<p>At the end of the worksheet, you should provide a list of sources in APA format. Use the examples below to make sure the references are presented correctly.</p>
<p>For most references:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Smith, M. (2013, January 1) <em>Title of web page</em>. Retrieved from http://completeurl.com/woiheongang/oagnaiengeng.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is no author information available:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Title of web page</em>. (2013, January 1) Retrieved from http://completeurl.com/woiheongang/oagnaiengeng.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is no date available:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Smith, M. (n.d.) <em>Title of web page</em>. Retrieved from http://completeurl.com/woiheongang/oagnaiengeng.html</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is no author or date information available:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>Title of web page</em>. (n.d.) Retrieved from http://completeurl.com/woiheongang/oagnaiengeng.html</p>
