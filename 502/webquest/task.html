  <h2>Task Overview</h2>
  <p>A friend of yours wants your help. She has decided that her old computer is too slow, and that it is time to get a new computer. She wants you to help her choose a computer that will meet her needs now and in the future.</p>
  <p>She wants to be able to do the following tasks with her computer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bring the computer with her to class so that she can use it to take notes or perform other tasks that the teacher might ask the class to do.</li>
    <li>Use Skype or Google+ to have video chats with her old high school friends back home.</li>
    <li>Connect a high definition monitor or TV to the computer so that she can work with two monitors at once.</li>
    <li>Play computer games in her spare time, especially popular, high-quality video games that have realistic graphics, like <em>Tomb Raider</em> or <em>Skyrim</em>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>She is also on a budget, so she doesn't  want to spend more than $1,000 for the entire system, including not only the computer, but also a mouse and other equipment that she might need. </p>
  <p>For this task, you will complete the following steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Use a form to identify the type of computer she needs, and research the minimum required components for what she intends to do.</li>
    <li>Compare your results to those of other students.</li>
    <li>Use the Web to reseach computer systems that will meet her needs.</li>
    <li>Create a document that will outline two possible systems for her to choose from, with details about why each system will meet her needs.</li>
    <li>Make a recommendation of the system that would most suit your friend's needs, based on your analysis.</li>
  </ol>
