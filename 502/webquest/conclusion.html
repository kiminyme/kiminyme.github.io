  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>After completing this evaluation, you should have a better idea of the steps anyone should take before buying a new computer or other forms of technology.</p>
  <p>As a reflection, do you believe that you learned anything new in this process? If you have bought a computer for yourself in the past, did you find out later that it really wasn't what you needed, or that it was missing features you would have liked to have? How do you think this kind of process would be useful to you in the future?</p>
  <p>As a general rule, there is no one system that meets the needs of every user. For this reason, you should always start with a list of what you want to do with a computer, rather than by choosing a system based on price or manufacturer right off the bat. You can then make your purchase based on that list. It may not always be possible to purchase the ideal system within your financial limits, though, so you may also need to prioritize the features based on how important they are. Another thing to consider is what options can be upgraded later, when you may have a little more money to spend on the system. </p>
