  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <section>
    <p>Now that you have learned what the different parts of a computer do, it's time to use that information to put together the perfect computer.</p>
  </section>
<h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Buying a new computer should be done in stages, whether you are buying a desktop computer, a notebook, a tablet, or a smart phone. If you go into a computer store, you are likely to be overwhelmed with the choices, and it is common for new computer users to make the mistake of buying a computer based on price and/or a salesperson's recommendation.</p>
    <p>In reality, you want to look carefully first at what you want the new device to do, and identify the features that you need in a new system ahead of time. Then, when you walk into a computer showroom, you can make more intelligent decisions in your purchase. This Web quest will walk you through that process. </p>
