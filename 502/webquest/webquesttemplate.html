  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>The Choosing a Computer WebQuest is designed to help students understand the process of choosing appropriate technology based on the needs of the end user.</p>
  <h3>Rationale</h3>
  <p>Many users who do not understand computers often buy a new computer based solely on price, or by depending on a computer sales person to choose a system for them. </p>
  <p>When a computer is purchased based on price alone, the user often finds later that the system doesn't have everything they expected. For example, buying a netbook for $200 looks like a great deal, but then the user may discover that it cannot be used to rip CDs because there is no optical drive, or that the keyboard is too small to use effectively.</p>
  <p>Similarly, it is not a good idea to rely on a sales person to choose for you. The sales person may be selling a product based more on how much commission they will receive or on a competition within the store, without necessarily trying to find a system that meets the user's needs. The result is that the user often buys more than they really need.</p>
  <h3>Learner Description</h3>
  <p>This WebQuest is designed for a first-year college computer concepts course, to be completed as a final assignment for the semester.</p>
  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
  <p>It is assumed that students completing the WebQuest have already spent time learning how to identify and compare various components of a computer system, including memory, ports, and the CPU, and that they are able to identify the operating system of a computer. Students should also have an understanding of the concept of &quot;minimum specifications&quot; as they relate to software that may be installed on a system. The student should also know how to perform Web searches to find specific information.</p>
  <p>In order to complete the WebQuest as indicated here, the students will need access to Microsoft Word to complete the forms provided. The class should have access to an online discussion board where files can be shared with other students, as well as to an online drop box for the completed assignment.</p>
  <h3>Instructional Objectives</h3>
  <p>Upon successful completion of this WebQuest, the student will be able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify the minimum system requirements based on a user's expectations for a new computer system</li>
    <li>Compare two or more elements of a computer system with similar elements from another system</li>
    <li>Evaluate a system to ensure that it meets the user's requirements</li>
    <li>Justify their choice for a new system</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Standards Addressed</h3>
  <p>The set of standards for this WebQuest are the Computer Hardware, Peripherals, and Troubleshooting section of the IC3 (Internet and Computing Core Certification).</p>
  <p>Specifically, this WebQuest addresses the ability to &quot;identify types of computers, how they process information, and the
    purpose and function of different hardware components,&quot; in the Computer Fundamentals section of the IC3.</p>
  <p>See the complete description of the requirements for the Computer Fundamentals section available at <a href="http://www.certiport.com/portal/common/documentlibrary/IC3_GS4_Computing_Fundamentals.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.certiport.com/portal/common/documentlibrary/IC3_GS4_Computing_Fundamentals.pdf</a></p>
  <h3>Subject Matter Description</h3>
  <p>This WebQuest follows theÂ <a href="http://www.webquest.org/index.php" target="_blank">model developed by Bernie Dodge and Tom March</a>. It contains the following sections for learners:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="stress">Introduction</span>: This section provides an overview to help learners to become familiar with the topic.</li>
    <li><span class="stress">Task</span>: The task to be completed is described in this section. Students will evaluate computer systems based on the requirements of a specific user and generate a recommendation for a system to be purchased.</li>
    <li><span class="stress">Process</span>: The list of steps to follow are provided. Students will generate a list of minimum system requirements based on the user's needs, and compare their findings to those of their classmates. They will then research and find computer systems that meet the minimum requirements and make a recommendation of a system that the user could purchase.</li>
    <li><span class="stress">Evaluation</span>: A rubric is provided to allow learners to score their projects. This same rubric will be used by the instructor to assign a grade for work completed in this WebQuest.</li>
    <li><span class="stress">Conclusion</span>: This section is used to prompt the learner to think about what they have learned during this WebQuest. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Assessment</h2>
  <p>Students will discuss the concepts covered in a public discussion board where their initial findings will be shared with other students. They will then research current systems and submit a document that compares two separate systems, with an analysis of which system would best suit the user's needs. A rubric is provided in the evaluation section of the WebQuest.</p>
