<h2>Email Etiquette</h2>

<p>Email is still a very common way to communicate with other people online, but there are expectations, especially when you are using email in formal communications. (See the box above.)</p>
<p>Along with using correct spelling and grammar, you should also consider the following when sending email:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email is asynchronous. This means that the person you sent the message to probably won't see it right away, and they may reply while you are not online to receive the reply. Give the recipient of the email message at least 24 hours (or one business day) to reply.</li>
  <li>Include a short subject line that describes the purpose of the email. This helps the reader identify your message more easily.</li>
  <li>Use a greeting line of some sort to be sure that the recipient knows the email is addressed to him or her. This can be especially useful if you accidentally use the wrong email address, or if the email is being copied to someone else.</li>
  <li>Include your name at the end of the email. For a formal message, you should put your full professional name. For a less formal email, your first name alone is fine.</li>
  <li>Avoid long signatures. Your name, position, and contact information are usually sufficient. There is no need to include inspirational quotes or pictures of your children at the bottom of every message you send.</li>
  <li>Don't write a book. Keep the message short and to the point. Provide only the information the recipient needs for the context, without including too much irrelevant detail.</li>
  <li>If you are sending a new message, use the NEW button to start a new message. If you must recycle an old message, change the subject line to reflect the new topic, and delete the old threads before starting the new message.</li>
  <li>Do not ask the recipient to reply to you by phone or using a different email address. If you would prefer to communicate by phone, call instead of sending an email, or send the email with the express purpose of finding a good time for the phone call.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>When you reply to email, follow these guidelines:<br>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use the REPLY button, not REPLY ALL, unless everyone who received the original message really needs your reply.</li>
  <li>Read the message carefully to make sure you understand what the sender needs from you. Don't just read the first few lines before replying.</li>
  <li>Try to respond as soon as you reasonably can, but don't respond in haste. Give yourself enough time to formulate a complete reply to their request.</li>
  <li>If you cannot give a complete reply within a day or so, send a message telling the sender why there is a delay in your response.</li>
  <li>Include enough of the original message so that the recipient does not have to remember the details of earlier emails in the conversation. In most cases, it is fine to allow the entire thread of the conversation to be included in each message, so that everyone can review what has already been discussed. </li>
  <li>If you must delete the older content, make sure to give context to your reply. For example, a reply like &quot;That's fine with me&quot; is only meaningful if the person reading it remembers what you are agreeing to. It would be better to say &quot;I can meet with you on Thursday at 9, as you suggested.&quot;</li>
</ul>
